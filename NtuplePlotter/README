This package is designed to read events in ggNtuple format, perform event selection and produce histograms as output.

Main internal parts:

EventTree - class to read the contents of the tree. Almost of a "MakeClass" kind.

Selector - class to do object selection. All objects are treated independently from others (electrons, photons, etc)
	Selected objects are stored as indices in vectors. Rho corrected isolations for 
	electrons, muons, photons are calculated and stored in vectors too.
	Most of the object cuts are public class parameters -> easy to have several selections in main loop.

EventPick - class to do event selection based on objects selected and event properties. 
	Here event related cuts are used, like minimum dR between photon and jet, minimum number of jets, etc.
	Cut flow table (histogram) is filled here.
	For easier handling the indices of objects that passed event level cuts are also stored in vectors.
	For photons results of certain cuts (passing isolation, sihih, etc) are stored in vectors too.
	In the end the flags PassPresel and PassAll are set.

HistCollect - class that holds several Histogrammer objects and fills them accordingly.
	Separation is made by leading photon region (barrel-endcap) and MC truth information.

Histogrammer - class to make histograms and fill them based on flags from EventPick.
	Object indices are taken from EventPick object.


Executables:

makeTemplates - read the list of files, perform event selection, save all histograms.

makeSkim - read the list of files, perform event selection, save events that passed selection in ggNtuple format.
	Allows to drop unnecessary branches.
